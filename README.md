# codequiz
This is my code quiz. Multiple choice questions relating to code that will test your knowledge. There is a timer that counts down to 0 so it is just as important to go as fast as you can while getting as many questions correct as you can. When the quiz is over it keeps track of your final score (how much time remaining you had upon completion).
